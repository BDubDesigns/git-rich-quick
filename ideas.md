# Ideas / Feature Notes

## Features

- Floating "+X" SVG from top status bar

  - Show LOC generated by employees per second.
  - Animate to float away every second (tied to GAME_TICK).
  - Implementation note: use `FloatingText` component pattern; trigger on passive LOC events.

- Version / update check

  - Display app version / commit hash.
  - Fetch endpoint to check latest client version; if outdated, show "Click to reload" action.

- Hidden click-side multiplier (discovery mechanic)

  - Alternating which side of the "Commit Code" button is clicked slowly increases a multiplier up to 2×.
  - Design: intentionally undocumented to encourage discovery; keep configurability in GameContext as a tunable flag.

- Konami Code Easter Egg (↑ ↓ ← → B A Enter)

  - Click button quadrants in the correct sequence: up, down, left, right (directional), then press `B`, `A`, then `Enter`.
  - Reward: 1.5× click multiplier for 30 seconds.
  - Design: intentionally hard pattern to encourage discovery and skill expression. Players must balance pattern execution with actual clicking during active play.
  - Why it works: Optional optimization (not mandatory), rewards exploration, breaks monotony of passive clicking, and provides skill-based power moments.
  - Implementation: Track quadrant clicks + keyboard input in GameContext; store pattern state and active duration; display activation feedback (e.g., "KONAMI ACTIVATED" notification).
  - Config tuning: `KONAMI_CODE_CONFIG = { multiplier: 1.5, durationSeconds: 30, patternResetTimeMs: 5000 }` (reset pattern if player waits too long between inputs).
  - Trade-off note: "Sub-optimal play" concern is actually a feature—mastering the pattern creates skill ceiling and makes skilled play satisfying.

- Random clickable popups (like Cookie Clicker)

  - Spawn every ~20s–2m (playtest to tune).
  - Rewards: large LOC, temporary +LOC/sec boost (e.g., 2 minutes), or other bonuses.
  - Implementation: config-driven spawn intervals and rewards; use existing floating popup system.

- Tier lock for hiring devs

  - Only show next-tier employee after buying 10 of prior tier (e.g., show junior after 10 interns).
  - Implementation: visibility rules in Shop component; config + state pattern — store unlock thresholds in `EMPLOYEE_CONFIGS`.

- Floating click text should reflect real values

  - Show actual LOC per click (e.g., "+12 LOC") and display current LOC-per-click in UI.
  - Use `calculateLOCPerClick(state)` for displayed value.

- News feed UI

  - Small in-game news stream (Twitter-like / Reddit / Hacker News style) for flavor and events.
  - Could be purely cosmetic; optional event hooks for timed bonuses.

- ButtonBox.jsx component refactor
  - Create reusable component for repeated button item styling.
  - Improve visuals: colored icons, consistent alignment (stacked or left-aligned).
  - Reuse ActionButton / FloatingText for interactions.

## Implementation Notes / Constraints

- Follow Config + State separation:
  - Add any new balance or spawn data to `GameContext.jsx` configs.
  - Track counts/timers in state only (no hardcoded balance values in components).
- Tie timers to GAME_TICK where appropriate (1s tick).
- Use existing helper functions:
  - `calculateLOCPerClick(state)`, `calculateLOCPerSecond(state)`, `getTotalClickBonus(state)`, etc.
- Make spawn intervals, rewards, unlock thresholds configurable for playtesting.

## Priorities

- P1: Floating "+X" SVG for passive LOC, tier lock for hires.
- P2: Random clickable popups, version check UI.
- P3: News feed, buttonbox UI polish, secret click-side multiplier polish.
